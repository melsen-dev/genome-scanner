# genome-scanner

`genome-scanner` is an open source application to scan for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from Variant Call File (VCF) files that result from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data analysis (e.g. sequencing.com, dantelabs.com).
It scans the user-provided VCF file (can be downloaded from sequencing provider) for annotated genes from the SNP database snpdb.csv and outputs a report table with associated risk or each found SNP.
This application is an implementation of the findings in referenced papers for research purposes only. It is not recommended as guidance in medical diagnosis and treatment.

# VCF File Compatibility
This application has been tested with VCF v4.2 files, see https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf for details on file format

# Python Code
Add requirements.txt

# Web Service
