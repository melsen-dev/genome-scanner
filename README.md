# genome-scanner

`genome-scanner` is an open source web service to scan for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from Variant Call File (VCF) files that result from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data analysis (e.g. sequencing.com, dantelabs.com).
It scannes the given VCF file (can be downloaded from sequencing provider) for annotated genes from the SNP database snpdb.csv and outputs a report table witha ssociated risk or each found SNP.
